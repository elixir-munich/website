# Elixir & Erlang Munich Website

The official [website](https://elixir-munich.org) for the Elixir & Erlang Munich community, serving as our central hub.

## Getting Started

> We recommend using [Jujutsu](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/) instead of Git for a better development experience.

```sh
jj git clone https://github.com/elixir-munich/website.git
cd website

mix setup

mix phx.server
```

Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) to see the site.

## Deployment

The application automatically deploys to Fly.io when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
